4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?**
   - Use simple language, provide explanations for technical terms, and include examples and visuals.

5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?**
   - Plain language ensures clarity and makes information accessible to a broader audience.
